# Project Overview

This project explores how AI and structured logic can support the translation and classification of medical devices based on FDA guidelines. Medical device classification requires careful interpretation of intended use, invasiveness, anatomical location, materials, and duration of contact. Errors can lead to safety risks and regulatory delays.

The goal of this project is to break down the classification process into clear components and explore how NLP and early ML techniques could assist in identifying key attributes and mapping devices to appropriate categories and risk classes.

This is a conceptual engineering project designed to demonstrate structured thinking, regulatory awareness, and responsible AI design.
