# Ethical Considerations

AI in healthcare must be approached with caution. Misclassification of medical devices can have serious consequences for patient safety and regulatory compliance.

## Key Principles

### Safety
AI should never replace regulatory review. Any automated classification must be validated by qualified experts.

### Transparency
Users should understand:
- Why a device was classified a certain way
- What attributes influenced the decision
- What assumptions the system makes

### Accuracy
Medical terminology must be interpreted carefully. NLP outputs must be reviewed for correctness.

### Responsible Use
