# Medical Device Translation & Risk Classification Tool

A conceptual AI/ML project exploring how structured logic, NLP, and early machine learning techniques can support the translation of medical device descriptions into standardized FDA device categories and risk classes. This project reflects my interest in responsible AI for healthcare and my background in benefits consulting, regulatory interpretation, and structured problem-solving.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Medical device classification is complex and highly regulated. Misclassification can lead to safety risks, compliance issues, and delays in patient access. This project explores how AI could support:

- Translating device descriptions into standardized terminology  
- Identifying key attributes (intended use, invasiveness, materials, duration of contact)  
- Mapping devices to FDA categories and risk classes  
- Supporting regulatory clarity and consistency  

This is a **conceptual engineering project**, not a production system. It demonstrates structured thinking, early ML reasoning, and responsible design principles.

- Problem decomposition  
- Data schema design  
- Feature identification  
- Early NLP exploration  
- Classification logic

## How to Navigate This Repo

To explore this project in a structured way:

1. Start with **docs/project_overview.md**  
   A high-level explanation of the problem, goals, and system design.

2. Review **docs/device_attributes.md**  
   The attribute schema that drives classification logic.

3. Read **docs/ethical_considerations.md**  
   The responsible‑AI framing and regulatory context.

4. Look at **docs/roadmap.md**  
   The planned phases and future development.

5. Explore the **notebooks/** folder  
   Each notebook walks through a conceptual part of the system:
   - 01: Problem definition  
   - 02: Device attributes & features  
   - 03: NLP exploration
