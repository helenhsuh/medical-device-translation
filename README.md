# Medical Device Translation & Risk Classification Tool

A conceptual AI/ML project exploring how structured logic, NLP, and early machine learning techniques can support the translation of medical device descriptions into standardized FDA device categories and risk classes. This project reflects my interest in responsible AI for healthcare and my background in benefits consulting, regulatory interpretation, and structured problem-solving.

## 🎯 Purpose

Medical device classification is complex and highly regulated. Misclassification can lead to safety risks, compliance issues, and delays in patient access. This project explores how AI could support:

- Translating device descriptions into standardized terminology  
- Identifying key attributes (intended use, invasiveness, materials, duration of contact)  
- Mapping devices to FDA categories and risk classes  
- Supporting regulatory clarity and consistency  

This is a **conceptual engineering project**, not a production system. It demonstrates structured thinking, early ML reasoning, and responsible design principles.
